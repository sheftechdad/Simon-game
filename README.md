Simon Game ðŸŽ®
A web-based Simon Game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This classic memory game challenges players to repeat an ever-growing sequence of colors and sounds, testing memory and concentration.

ðŸš€ Features

Start the game by pressing the 'A' key
Level progression: Each level introduces a new color to the sequence
Interactive gameplay: The player must watch the color sequence and repeat it correctly
Fully responsive design with CSS
Dynamic and engaging user interface created with HTML and CSS
JavaScript logic handles gameplay, sequence generation, and user interaction

ðŸŽ® How to Play

Press the 'A' key to start the game.
A sequence of colors will flash on the screen. Memorize the sequence.
Repeat the sequence by clicking the color buttons in the same order.
For every correct sequence, you'll advance to the next level, where the sequence will become one step longer.
If you press the wrong sequence, the game will restart, and you can try again!
